/* GalaxyRay dashboard - theme bootstrap.
 *
 * A classic (non-module, non-deferred) script in <head>, so it runs before the
 * first paint. That is the whole point of it being separate from app.js: a
 * module is deferred by definition, so the page would paint once with the
 * `prefers-color-scheme` palette and then repaint in the stored one — a visible
 * flash on every load for anyone who chose a theme that differs from their
 * operating system's. (Issue #713.)
 *
 * It deliberately does not touch the API key. Nothing here reads or writes
 * storage other than the single theme preference below, and no value from it
 * ever reaches a URL, so a key stored in the same origin's localStorage cannot
 * leak through this path.
 *
 * CSP note: `script-src 'self'` allows this file (it is served from the same
 * origin by the gateway) and an inline script would not be, so the
 * `data-theme` attribute is set from a real file rather than a <script> block.
 *
 * Design tokens (issue #685): the colour and spacing custom properties live in
 * dashboard.css on `:root`, and the dark palette is selected by the
 * `data-theme="dark"` attribute this file sets. The attribute is therefore the
 * single switch that flips every token, which is why the resolved theme is
 * pinned here rather than left to `prefers-color-scheme` alone.
 *
 * Status tokens (issues #821, #822): status pills must not rely on colour
 * alone. Each status therefore has a matching icon/shape (rendered from CSS
 * masks in dashboard.css, so no extra markup or network request is needed) and
 * a per-status icon colour token. The token set is identical in the light and
 * dark palettes — only the values differ — so the same markup renders in both:
 *
 *   --status-ok-fg / --status-ok-icon
 *   --status-warn-fg / --status-warn-icon
 *   --status-error-fg / --status-error-icon
 *   --status-info-fg / --status-info-icon
 *   --status-neutral-fg / --status-neutral-icon
 *
 * The icon tokens are chosen to stay distinguishable under the common forms of
 * colour blindness (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia) because the shape,
 * not the hue, carries the meaning. In `forced-colors: active` (Windows High
 * Contrast and equivalents) dashboard.css overrides these with system colours
 * (`CanvasText`, `Highlight`, `LinkText`, ...) and keeps focus rings visible
 * via `outline-color: Highlight`, so nothing here needs to detect that mode.
 *
 * None of these tokens are read or written by this file; they are documented
 * here only so the token set stays discoverable next to the theme switch.
